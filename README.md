# Discovering analyzing and predicting Stroke using DataMining techniques
## A Little about the project 
This project is a project I worked on as part of my university DataMining course.
It is a project regarding stroke prediction; 
It's goal is to find as many "early signs" for stroke, helping doctors / nurses or other health professionals to identify risks, prevent and treat patients with care based on real data.
In a lot of ways its much more of a research project foucusing on the data, diving into medical proven facts and using those facts and known factors to test and evaluate our models, than a "regular" data-science project
with the ci/cd mindset (plan -> code -> build -> test -> release -> deploy -> operate)
