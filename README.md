## A Little about the project ‚ãÜÔΩ°Àö ‚òÅÔ∏é ÀöÔΩ°‚ãÜÔΩ°Àö‚òΩÀöÔΩ°‚ãÜ 
This project was completed as part of my university DataMining course.üéì
It is a project regarding stroke prediction; 
It's goal is to find as many "early signs" for stroke, helping doctors / nurses or other health professionals to identify risks, prevent and treat patients with care based on real data.

In a lot of ways its much more of a research project foucusing on the data, diving into medical proven facts and using those facts and known factors to test, verify, and evaluate our models, than a "regular" data-science project
with the ci/cd mindset (plan -> code -> build -> test -> release -> deploy -> operate).

> The project incorporates AI/ML/Deep Learning techniques used alongside some statistical analysis based models and label classification methods.

## The main data mining goals of the project üß™üóÉÔ∏èüéØ
### 1. **Accurate prediction of stroke risk:** 
  - Developing a predictive model that can identify various phenomena and trends that "signal" a chance of experiencing a stroke.
  Maximizing the model's precision, accuracy, F1 score while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

### 2. **Discovering the most influential characteristics and factors:**
  - Discovering which characteristics (e.g: age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and glucose levels) are most influential on the chance for stroke in order to interpret model behavior and gain medical insights.

### 3. **Handling imperfect data:**
  - Develop effective strategies or techniques for managing missing values, noisy data and information imbalance
  using SMOTE/ median fill / average fill and more...

### 4. **Model Evaluation:**
  - Goal: To compare several prediction models, including AI-based models
  (such as KNN, SVM, RANDOM FOREST, logistic regression, XGBoost) to determine the best fit.

### 5. **Generalization and prevention of overfitting:**
  - Goal: To ensure that the model can correctly generalize to unseen patient data.

## Our dataset:

  - Id - is a unique integer identifier assigned to each patient. It ranges from 67 to 72,940 and does not contain missing values.
  - Gender - is a categorical attribute indicating the patient's gender. It can take one of three values: "male", "female" or "other", with no missing values.
  - Age - is a continuous numeric variable ( float ) representing the patient's age. The values range from 0.08 years to a maximum age of 82 years, and there are no missing values in this field.
