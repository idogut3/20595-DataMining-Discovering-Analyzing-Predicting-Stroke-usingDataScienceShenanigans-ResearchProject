## A Little about the project 
This project was completed as part of myuniversity DataMining course.
It is a project regarding stroke prediction; 
It's goal is to find as many "early signs" for stroke, helping doctors / nurses or other health professionals to identify risks, prevent and treat patients with care based on real data.

In a lot of ways its much more of a research project foucusing on the data, diving into medical proven facts and using those facts and known factors to test, verify, and evaluate our models, than a "regular" data-science project
with the ci/cd mindset (plan -> code -> build -> test -> release -> deploy -> operate).

The Link for the dataset I used: [kaggle dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data).

The project incorporates AI/ML/Deep Learning techniques used alongside some statistical analysis based models and label classification methods. 
I encourage you to scroll on to dive deeper into the project.
